# simple-CLI-scripts-for-CC
I write some CLI scripts during work to simplify some boring things.  I am a student working on Computational Chemistry so some of them are for the thing I am doing.
They work with, maybe, bash or python or anything can work with codes which can be called scripts.
You shall read the script first, not the codes but the comments in it.  Usually the introduction of a script are in the comments through it.
But you are always welcome to read the scripts.  They are simple but easy understand and to use.  And they may be powerful.
Good luck if you did not known what will happened before you use them. (^_^)

## List of the scripts
